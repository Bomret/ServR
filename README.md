ServR
=====

A barebone reactive http server similar to the one in node's http module.

This project started as a simple exercise to learn more about the awesome Reactive Extensions (https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions) and writing http servers. It's internals are influenced by the Anna project (https://github.com/jfromaniello/Anna).
